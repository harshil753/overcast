# Implement tasks 8 to 10 (2025-10-06 00:19Z)

/implement tasks 8-10

--- Cursor Command: implement.md ---
---
description: Execute the implementation plan by processing and executing all tasks defined in tasks.md
---

The user input can be provided directly by the agent or as a command argument - you **MUST** consider it before proceeding with the prompt (if not empty).

User input:

tasks 8-10

1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute.

2. Load and analyze the implementation context:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios

3. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements

4. Execute implementation following the task plan:
   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  
   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding

5. Implementation execution rules:
   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios
   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints
   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services
   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation

6. Progress tracking and error handling:
   - Report progress after each completed task
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.

7. Completion validation:
   - Verify all required tasks are completed
   - Check that implemented features match the original specification
   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan
   - Report final status with summary of completed work

Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/tasks` first to regenerate the task list.

Perfect! I have successfully implemented tasks 8-10 from the video recording feature specification. Here's a summary of what was completed:

## Tasks 8-10 Implementation Summary

### T008: Integration Test Recording Error Handling ✅
**File**: `tests/integration/test_recording_errors.test.ts`
- **Comprehensive error scenario testing** including permission denial, storage quota exceeded, MediaRecorder API not supported
- **Retry mechanism testing** with exponential backoff and failure handling
- **Network interruption scenarios** and recovery options
- **Multiple simultaneous error handling** with proper error prioritization
- **Cleanup and download error scenarios** with user-friendly error messages

### T009: Unit Test Recording Utilities ✅
**File**: `tests/unit/recording-utils.test.ts`
- **MediaRecorder integration testing** with comprehensive mocking
- **Error handling and retry logic** with exponential backoff validation
- **Utility function testing** for duration formatting, file size formatting, status messages
- **Recording validation** with edge cases and business rule enforcement
- **Browser compatibility testing** for unsupported environments

### T010: Unit Test Storage Utilities ✅
**File**: `tests/unit/storage-utils.test.ts`
- **localStorage CRUD operations** with comprehensive error handling
- **TTL cleanup system testing** with expired recording removal
- **Storage quota management** with usage calculation and monitoring
- **JSON serialization/deserialization** with error recovery
- **User session state management** with proper cleanup

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: All three test files provide extensive coverage of recording functionality, error scenarios, and edge cases.

2. **TDD Approach**: Tests are written to fail initially (as required by the TDD approach), providing a solid foundation for implementation.

3. **Error Handling**: Extensive testing of error scenarios including permission denial, storage quota exceeded, network interruptions, and browser compatibility issues.

4. **Mocking Strategy**: Proper mocking of browser APIs (MediaRecorder, localStorage, navigator.mediaDevices) to ensure reliable test execution.

5. **Business Logic Validation**: Tests validate recording state transitions, TTL management, retry logic, and storage quota enforcement.

All tests follow the existing project patterns and conventions, with proper TypeScript typing and comprehensive error handling. The tests are ready to be executed and will fail initially (as intended by TDD), providing a solid foundation for the implementation phase.

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Both test files provide extensive coverage of their respective components and hooks, testing all major functionality and edge cases.

2. **Mocking Strategy**: Proper mocking of browser APIs (MediaRecorder, URL, document), utility functions, and storage operations to ensure reliable test execution.

3. **React Testing Library Integration**: Tests use React Testing Library best practices with proper user interaction simulation and accessibility testing.

4. **Error Scenario Testing**: Extensive testing of error conditions including permission denial, storage quota exceeded, network failures, and browser compatibility issues.

5. **State Management Testing**: Comprehensive testing of hook state management, including initialization, state transitions, and cleanup.

6. **Integration Testing**: Tests validate the integration between components, hooks, and utility functions.

All tests follow the existing project patterns and conventions, with proper TypeScript typing and comprehensive error handling. The tests are ready to be executed and will provide a solid foundation for ensuring the recording functionality works correctly.
