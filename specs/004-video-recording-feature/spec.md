# Feature Specification: Video Recording Feature

**Feature Branch**: `004-video-recording-feature`  
**Created**: 2025-01-05  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to add a feature to this existing app that add's the functionality to be able to record the the video chat while inside one of the chat rooms and the option to download the video to local storage once the room is closed. There should be a start recording button and stop recording button that appears next to the button to leave the room. if the recording is stopped while the classroom is still open allow the user to click the record button again which will start a new video recording. Once the classroom is closed allow the user to download each recording separately as different files."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-05
- Q: Who should be able to start recordings in a classroom session? ‚Üí A: Any participant can start their own recording
- Q: What should be recorded when a user starts recording? ‚Üí A: User's own stream plus any shared content they can see
- Q: How long should recordings be kept before automatic deletion? ‚Üí A: 24 hours after classroom ends
- Q: What should happen when recording fails due to technical issues? ‚Üí A: Automatically retry recording 3 times, then show error
- Q: How should the system handle recording when other participants join or leave during an active recording? ‚Üí A: Show notification to new participants that recording is active

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a classroom participant, I want to record video sessions so that I can review the content later and have a permanent record of the classroom interactions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is in an active classroom session, **When** they click the "Start Recording" button, **Then** the system begins recording the video chat and the button changes to "Stop Recording"
2. **Given** a recording is in progress, **When** the user clicks "Stop Recording", **Then** the recording stops and is saved, and the button changes back to "Start Recording"
3. **Given** a user has stopped a recording but is still in the classroom, **When** they click "Start Recording" again, **Then** a new recording session begins
4. **Given** a user has multiple recordings from a classroom session, **When** they leave the classroom, **Then** they can download each recording as a separate file
5. **Given** a user is recording, **When** they leave the classroom without stopping the recording, **Then** the recording automatically stops and is saved for download

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user's browser crashes during recording?
- How does the system handle multiple users recording simultaneously?
- What happens when storage space is full during recording?
- How does the system handle network interruptions during recording?
- What happens if the user tries to download recordings before leaving the classroom?
- What happens when recording fails after 3 retry attempts?
- How does the system handle participants joining/leaving during active recording?
- What happens when recordings reach the 24-hour retention limit?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a "Start Recording" button visible next to the "Leave Room" button in active classroom sessions
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a "Stop Recording" button that appears when recording is active
- **FR-003**: System MUST record all video and audio streams from the classroom session when recording is active
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to start multiple recording sessions within the same classroom session
- **FR-005**: System MUST automatically stop recording when the user leaves the classroom
- **FR-006**: System MUST save each recording as a separate file with unique identifiers
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide download functionality for all recordings after leaving the classroom
- **FR-008**: System MUST persist recordings for 24 hours after classroom ends, then automatically delete them
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle recording state transitions (start/stop) without interrupting the classroom experience
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide visual feedback to indicate when recording is active
- **FR-011**: System MUST record the user's own video/audio stream plus any shared content visible to the user
- **FR-012**: System MUST automatically retry recording up to 3 times if technical failures occur, then show error message
- **FR-013**: System MUST notify new participants when they join a classroom with active recording
- **FR-014**: System MUST allow any participant to start their own recording session

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Recording**: Represents a single recording session with start time, duration, and associated classroom session
- **Recording File**: Represents the actual video file stored locally with metadata for download
- **Recording State**: Tracks whether recording is active, paused, or stopped for the current user
