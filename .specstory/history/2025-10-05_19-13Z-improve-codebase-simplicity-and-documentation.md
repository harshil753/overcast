# Improve codebase simplicity and documentation (2025-10-05 19:13Z)

_**User (2025-10-05 19:13Z)**_

/constitution I want this codebase to be simple for a new developer to understand use less files and add more descriptive comments of the operations being performed

--- Cursor Command: constitution.md ---

description: Create or update the project constitution from interactive or provided principle inputs, ensuring all dependent templates stay in sync.

The user input to you can be provided directly by the agent or as a command argument - you **MUST** consider it before proceeding with the prompt (if not empty).

User input:

I want this codebase to be simple for a new developer to understand use less files and add more descriptive comments of the operations being performed

You are updating the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. This file is a TEMPLATE containing placeholder tokens in square brackets (e.g. `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]`). Your job is to (a) collect/derive concrete values, (b) fill the template precisely, and (c) propagate any amendments across dependent artifacts.

Follow this execution flow:

1. Load the existing constitution template at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.
   - Identify every placeholder token of the form `[ALL_CAPS_IDENTIFIER]`.
   **IMPORTANT**: The user might require less or more principles than the ones used in the template. If a number is specified, respect that - follow the general template. You will update the doc accordingly.

2. Collect/derive values for placeholders:
   - If user input (conversation) supplies a value, use it.
   - Otherwise infer from existing repo context (README, docs, prior constitution versions if embedded).
   - For governance dates: `RATIFICATION_DATE` is the original adoption date (if unknown ask or mark TODO), `LAST_AMENDED_DATE` is today if changes are made, otherwise keep previous.
   - `CONSTITUTION_VERSION` must increment according to semantic versioning rules:
     * MAJOR: Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions.
     * MINOR: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance.
     * PATCH: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements.
   - If version bump type ambiguous, propose reasoning before finalizing.

3. Draft the updated constitution content:
   - Replace every placeholder with concrete text (no bracketed tokens left except intentionally retained template slots that the project has chosen not to define yet—explicitly justify any left).
   - Preserve heading hierarchy and comments can be removed once replaced unless they still add clarifying guidance.
   - Ensure each Principle section: succinct name line, paragraph (or bullet list) capturing non‑negotiable rules, explicit rationale if not obvious.
   - Ensure Governance section lists amendment procedure, versioning policy, and compliance review expectations.

4. Consistency propagation checklist (convert prior checklist into active validations):
   - Read `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` and ensure any "Constitution Check" or rules align with updated principles.
   - Read `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` for scope/requirements alignment—update if constitution adds/removes mandatory sections or constraints.
   - Read `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` and ensure task categorization reflects new or removed principle-driven task types (e.g., observability, versioning, testing discipline).
   - Read each command file in `.specify/templates/commands/*.md` (including this one) to verify no outdated references (agent-specific names like CLAUDE only) remain when generic guidance is required.
   - Read any runtime guidance docs (e.g., `README.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, or agent-specific guidance files if present). Update references to principles changed.

5. Produce a Sync Impact Report (prepend as an HTML comment at top of the constitution file after update):
   - Version change: old → new
   - List of modified principles (old title → new title if renamed)
   - Added sections
   - Removed sections
   - Templates requiring updates (✅ updated / ⚠ pending) with file paths
   - Follow-up TODOs if any placeholders intentionally deferred.

6. Validation before final output:
   - No remaining unexplained bracket tokens.
   - Version line matches report.
   - Dates ISO format YYYY-MM-DD.
   - Principles are declarative, testable, and free of vague language ("should" → replace with MUST/SHOULD rationale where appropriate).

7. Write the completed constitution back to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (overwrite).

8. Output a final summary to the user with:
   - New version and bump rationale.
   - Any files flagged for manual follow-up.
   - Suggested commit message (e.g., `docs: amend constitution to vX.Y.Z (principle additions + governance update)`).

Formatting & Style Requirements:
- Use Markdown headings exactly as in the template (do not demote/promote levels).
- Wrap long rationale lines to keep readability (<100 chars ideally) but do not hard enforce with awkward breaks.
- Keep a single blank line between sections.
- Avoid trailing whitespace.

If the user supplies partial updates (e.g., only one principle revision), still perform validation and version decision steps.

If critical info missing (e.g., ratification date truly unknown), insert `TODO(<FIELD_NAME>): explanation` and include in the Sync Impact Report under deferred items.

Do not create a new template; always operate on the existing `.specify/memory/constitution.md` file.

I'll help you create a project constitution that emphasizes simplicity for new developers, with fewer files and more descriptive comments. Let me start by examining the current codebase structure and then create the constitution.

Now I can see the current state. The constitution template exists but is mostly placeholders. Based on the codebase analysis, I can see this is a Next.js video classroom application with some complexity that could be simplified. Let me create a constitution focused on simplicity for new developers.

Perfect! I have successfully created and updated the project constitution with principles focused on simplicity for new developers. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Constitution Created: Version 1.0.0

**New Version**: 1.0.0 (Major version - new constitution with fundamental principles)

**Core Principles Established**:

1. **Simplicity First** - Every feature starts with the simplest approach, complex patterns require justification
2. **Single File Preference** - Keep related functionality together, minimize file fragmentation  
3. **Comment-Driven Development** - Explain WHY decisions were made, make code educational
4. **Newcomer-Friendly Architecture** - Clear naming, no jargon, explain advanced patterns
5. **Test-Driven Clarity** - Tests serve as living documentation with plain language

**Templates Updated**:
- ✅ **plan-template.md** - Updated Constitution Check section with specific principles
- ✅ **tasks-template.md** - Enhanced with newcomer-friendly task descriptions and comment requirements
- ⚠️ **spec-template.md** - No changes needed (already focused on business requirements)

**Key Improvements for New Developers**:
- Tasks now include explicit requirements for comprehensive comments
- File organization emphasizes keeping related code together
- Test names must describe scenarios in plain language
- Architecture decisions require educational explanations
- Setup includes comprehensive README requirements

**Suggested Commit Message**: 
```
docs: amend constitution to v1.0.0 (simplicity principles + newcomer-friendly development)
```

The constitution now enforces a development approach that prioritizes code clarity, reduces file fragmentation, and ensures that every piece of code is educational for new developers joining the project.

The user input to you can be provided directly by the agent or as a command argument - you **MUST** consider it before proceeding with the prompt (if not empty).

User input:

When the user clicks a room from instructor mode they are given additional instructor privileges such as the ability to mute participants and begin breakout rooms.  You should reference the image provided for the functional flow.

The text the user typed after `/specify` in the triggering message **is** the feature description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `we are looking to build a video based classroom application called Overcast. The application provides a main lobby that displays 6 potential classrooms that the user can drop into. When they click on one of the classrooms they are taken to a live video feed of the classroom.

Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

Given that feature description, do this:

1. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json "we are looking to build a video based classroom application called Overcast.

All file paths must be absolute.
  **IMPORTANT** You must only ever run this script once. The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for.
2. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.
3. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.
4. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, and readiness for the next phase.

Note: The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.

I can see there are already two features (001 and 002), so the next one should be 003. Let me create the new feature directory and spec file:


---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
mkdir -p "specs\003-overcast-video-classroom"
