# Feature Specification: Overcast Video Classroom Application

**Feature Branch**: `003-overcast-video-classroom`  
**Created**: 2025-10-05  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "we are looking to build a video based classroom application called Overcast. The application provides a main lobby that displays 6 potential classrooms that the user can drop into. When they click on one of the classrooms they are taken to a live video feed of the classroom. They can, at any point, return to the lobby to attend a different classroom. Alternatively if a user clicks the instructor option from the lobby they enter into Instructor mode. When the user clicks a room from instructor mode they are given additional instructor privileges such as the ability to mute participants and begin breakout rooms."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: What authentication approach should users follow before accessing the lobby? ‚Üí A: Simple name entry only (no password/login required)
- Q: What is the maximum number of participants allowed per classroom? ‚Üí A: 10 participants (small group sessions)
- Q: How should instructor privileges work when multiple instructors are in the same classroom? ‚Üí A: All instructors have equal privileges (any instructor can mute, create breakout rooms)
- Q: When an instructor mutes a participant, should the participant be able to unmute themselves? ‚Üí A: Yes, participants can unmute themselves (instructor mute is a suggestion/request)
- Q: Are classroom sessions persistent (always available) or do they have scheduled start/end times? ‚Üí A: On-demand sessions (created when first user joins, ended when last user leaves)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to participate in live video classroom sessions. They can browse 6 available classrooms from a main lobby and join any classroom as either a student (to view and participate) or as an instructor (to manage the session with additional controls). Users can freely move between classrooms and return to the lobby at any time.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user opens the application, **When** they enter their name, **Then** they should be taken to the main lobby showing 6 available classrooms displayed with identifiable names (Cohort 1-6)
2. **Given** a user is in the main lobby, **When** they select "Students" mode and click a classroom, **Then** they should join that classroom's live video feed as a participant
3. **Given** a user is in the main lobby, **When** they select "Instructors" mode and click a classroom, **Then** they should join that classroom's live video feed with instructor privileges
4. **Given** a user is in any classroom (Student or Instructor mode), **When** they click "Return to Main Lobby", **Then** they should be taken back to the lobby showing all 6 classrooms
5. **Given** a user is in a classroom as an instructor, **When** they access the control panel, **Then** they should be able to mute individual participants and create breakout rooms
6. **Given** a user switches from one classroom to another, **When** they join the new classroom, **Then** their previously selected role (Student/Instructor) should be maintained

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a classroom reaches maximum capacity of 10 participants?
- How does the system handle video/audio quality when multiple participants join?
- What happens if a user loses network connection while in a classroom?
- What happens to breakout rooms when an instructor who created them leaves (while other instructors remain)?
- How does the system handle participants who join without camera/microphone permissions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a main lobby interface showing 6 distinct classrooms labeled Cohort 1 through Cohort 6
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a mode toggle in the lobby allowing users to select between "Students" and "Instructors" roles
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to join any of the 6 classrooms by clicking on the classroom representation
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide live video feed functionality when users join a classroom
- **FR-005**: System MUST display the classroom name/identifier (e.g., "Cohort 1: Class Session") in the classroom view
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a "Return to Main Lobby" button visible in all classroom views
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to leave a classroom and join a different classroom without logging out
- **FR-008**: System MUST display an instructor control panel when users join a classroom in Instructor mode
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow instructors to mute individual participants
- **FR-019**: System MUST allow participants to unmute themselves after being muted by an instructor
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow instructors to create breakout rooms [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How many breakout rooms can be created? How are participants assigned to breakout rooms - manual or automatic?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain separate video sessions for each of the 6 classrooms simultaneously
- **FR-012**: System MUST support multiple instructors in the same classroom with equal privileges (all instructors can mute participants and create breakout rooms)

- **FR-014**: System MUST support users joining and leaving classrooms dynamically without disrupting other participants
- **FR-015**: System MUST require users to enter their name before accessing the lobby (no password required)
- **FR-016**: System MUST enforce a maximum capacity of 10 participants per classroom
- **FR-018**: System MUST prevent additional users from joining a classroom when it reaches 10 participants
- **FR-017**: System MUST create classroom sessions on-demand when the first user joins a classroom
- **FR-020**: System MUST automatically end a classroom session when the last participant leaves
- **FR-021**: System MUST allow users to join an empty classroom and automatically initiate a new session

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Classroom (Cohort)**: Represents one of the 6 available video session spaces, identified by name (Cohort 1-6), maintains list of active participants, session created on-demand when first user joins
- **User Session**: Represents a user's current state including their selected role (Student/Instructor), current classroom location, and connection status
- **Participant**: Represents a user within a specific classroom session, has audio/video state, mute status, and role designation
- **Instructor Control Panel**: Interface element providing access to instructor-specific actions like muting participants and managing breakout rooms
- **Breakout Room**: Sub-session created within a classroom for smaller group discussions, contains subset of main classroom participants
