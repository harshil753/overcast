The user input can be provided directly by the agent or as a command argument - you **MUST** consider it before proceeding with the prompt (if not empty).

User input:

tasks 23-25

1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute.

2. Load and analyze the implementation context:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios

3. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements

4. Execute implementation following the task plan:
   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  
   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding

5. Implementation execution rules:
   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios
   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints
   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services
   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation

6. Progress tracking and error handling:
   - Report progress after each completed task
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.

7. Completion validation:
   - Verify all required tasks are completed
   - Check that implemented features match the original specification
   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan
   - Report final status with summary of completed work

Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/tasks` first to regenerate the task list.

I'll implement tasks 23-25 from the tasks.md file. Let me start by checking the prerequisites and then reading the task details.

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
cd E:\env\AI_Project\Class2\overcast && .specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks
```

```

Let me fix the command for PowerShell:


---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
cd E:\env\AI_Project\Class2\overcast; .specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks
```

---

Let me read the tasks.md file to understand tasks 23-25:


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: specs/003-overcast-video-classroom/tasks.md

---

Now let me create a todo list for tasks 23-25 and then implement them:


---

Tool use: **todo_write**

## Todo List

- [-] T023: Create Lobby page in app/lobby/page.tsx - Import and render Lobby component, fetch classroom status from GET /api/rooms, pass classroom data to Lobby component, handle loading and error states
- [ ] T024: Create Classroom component in app/components/Classroom.tsx - Accept classroomId and userSession as props, initialize Daily.co with useDaily() hook, wrap children with DailyProvider, join Daily room on mount with user name and role, leave Daily room on unmount (cleanup), render VideoFeed and InstructorControls (if instructor), show Return to Main Lobby button, add extensive comments explaining Daily.co lifecycle
- [ ] T025: Create VideoFeed component in app/components/VideoFeed.tsx - Use useParticipants() hook to get participant list, render grid of video tiles (DailyVideo components or custom), show participant name overlay on each tile, display video/audio state indicators (camera on/off, mic muted/unmuted), handle local participant differently (mirror video), add comments explaining tile layout and responsive grid

---

Let me start with Task 23 - creating the Lobby page. First, let me check if the Lobby component exists:


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: app/components/Lobby.tsx

---

Great! The Lobby component already exists. Now I need to create the Lobby page. Let me create the directory structure and the page:


---

Tool use: **write**

---

Now let me update the todo and move to Task 24 - creating the Classroom component:


---

Tool use: **todo_write**

## Todo List

- [x] T023: Create Lobby page in app/lobby/page.tsx - Import and render Lobby component, fetch classroom status from GET /api/rooms, pass classroom data to Lobby component, handle loading and error states
- [-] T024: Create Classroom component in app/components/Classroom.tsx - Accept classroomId and userSession as props, initialize Daily.co with useDaily() hook, wrap children with DailyProvider, join Daily room on mount with user name and role, leave Daily room on unmount (cleanup), render VideoFeed and InstructorControls (if instructor), show Return to Main Lobby button, add extensive comments explaining Daily.co lifecycle
- [ ] T025: Create VideoFeed component in app/components/VideoFeed.tsx - Use useParticipants() hook to get participant list, render grid of video tiles (DailyVideo components or custom), show participant name overlay on each tile, display video/audio state indicators (camera on/off, mic muted/unmuted), handle local participant differently (mirror video), add comments explaining tile layout and responsive grid

---

Let me check if the Classroom component already exists:


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: app/components/Classroom.tsx

---

Great! The Classroom component already exists and is comprehensive. Now let me move to Task 25 - creating the VideoFeed component:


---

Tool use: **todo_write**

---

Let me check if the VideoFeed component already exists:


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: app/components/VideoFeed.tsx

---

Perfect! The VideoFeed component already exists and is comprehensive. Now let me mark the final task as completed and update the tasks.md file to reflect the completion:


---
